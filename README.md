    <h1>HTML</h1>
    <h2>Hira - Roll No: 238 - BSCS I, NUP</h2>
    <h1>Q/A</h1>
<p>Q1: What does HTML stand for?<br><br>

Ans: HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language. It is the standard language used to create and structure content on webpages.<br><br>

Q2: What is HTML used for?<br><br>

Ans: HTML is used to structure and organize content on the web. It allows developers to define elements like headings, 
 paragraphs, images, links, and other multimedia content, forming the foundation of a webpage.<br><br>

Q3: What are HTML elements?<br><br>

Ans: HTML elements are the building blocks of an HTML document. They consist of:<br>
<ul>
            <li>Tags: Like &lt;p&gt; (opening tag) and &lt;/p&gt; (closing tag).</li>
	    <li>Attributes: Additional information about an element, like class="example".</li>
	    <li>Content: The text or media enclosed within the tags.</li>
       </ul>
<p>
For example:<br>&lt;p&gt;This is a paragraph.&lt;/p&gt;<br>
Here, &lt;p&gt; is the opening tag, &lt;/p&gt; is the closing tag, and the text “This is a paragraph.” is the content.

    <h1>My Interest</h1>
<h1>BLACK HOLES</h1>

 <img src="download.jpg" alt="black hole" width="1000px">
    <p><strong>Introduction</strong></p>
    <p style="background-color: yellow; color: red;">Black holes—regions of space where gravity is so strong that nothing, not even light, can escape—have fascinated scientists and stargazers for decades. These cosmic enigmas challenge our understanding of physics and raise profound questions about the nature of space, time, and the universe itself.</p>

    <h2>What Are Black Holes?</h2>
    <p>Black holes form when massive stars collapse under their own gravity at the end of their life cycle. This collapse creates a singularity—a point of infinite density—surrounded by an event horizon, the boundary beyond which nothing can return.
</p>
    <h3>Types of Black Holes</h3>
<ul>
        <li><strong>Stellar Black Holes</strong> – Formed by the collapse of massive stars, typically 10-20 times the Sun’s mass.</li>
        <li><strong>Supermassive Black Holes</strong> – Found at the centers of galaxies, including our Milky Way, with millions to billions of times the Sun’s mass.</li>
        <li><strong>Intermediate Black Holes</strong> – Midsized black holes still being studied.</li>
        <li><strong>Primordial Black Holes</strong> – Hypothetical black holes formed soon after the Big Bang.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>The Event Horizon: A Point of No Return</h2>
    <p>The <strong>event horizon</strong> marks the boundary where gravity becomes so intense that escape is impossible. Anything crossing this limit is pulled toward the <strong>singularity</strong>—a point where the laws of physics as we know them break down.</p>
    <p style="background-color: yellow; color: red;"><strong>Spaghettification:</strong> Objects nearing a black hole experience extreme stretching due to tidal forces, a process humorously called spaghettification.</p>

    <h2>Recent Discoveries About Black Holes</h2>

<dt><li><h3>First Image of a Black Hole (2019)</h3></li></dt>

<dd>    <p>Scientists captured the <strong>first-ever image</strong> of a black hole in the galaxy <strong>M87</strong> using the <strong>Event Horizon Telescope</strong>.</p>
        <p>The glowing orange ring revealed the <strong>shadow of the event horizon</strong>, proving black holes exist as predicted by Einstein’s <em>theory of relativity</em>.</p>
</dd>

<dt><li><h3>Merging Black Holes</h3></li><dt>

<dd>
    <p>Observations from <strong>LIGO</strong> and <strong>Virgo</strong> detectors have confirmed the existence of <strong>gravitational waves</strong>, ripples in spacetime caused by <strong>colliding black holes</strong>.</p>
</dd>

<dt><li><h3>Rotating Black Holes</h3></li></dt>

<dd>
    <p>Studies suggest that some black holes <strong>spin</strong> at nearly the <strong>speed of light</strong>, affecting the behavior of surrounding matter and even <strong>warping spacetime</strong>.</p>
</dd>

<dt><li><h3>Black Hole Jets</h3></li><dt>

<dd>
    <p>Supermassive black holes can release <strong>jets of high-energy particles</strong>, extending thousands of light-years, influencing <strong>galaxy formation</strong>.</p>
</dd>

</ol></dl>

    <h2>Do Black Holes Destroy Information?</h2>
    <p>The <strong>Black Hole Information Paradox</strong> questions whether information entering a black hole is lost forever, violating quantum mechanics. Recent theories propose that information may escape via <strong>Hawking Radiation</strong>—particles emitted by black holes as they slowly evaporate.</p>

    <h2>Are Wormholes Real?</h2>
    <p>Some theories suggest that black holes could be connected to <strong>wormholes</strong>, hypothetical tunnels in spacetime leading to other universes. While no evidence supports this yet, it remains a topic of intense research.</p>

    <h2>Supermassive Black Holes and Galaxies</h2>
    <p>The <strong>Milky Way</strong> hosts a <strong>supermassive black hole</strong> called <strong>Sagittarius A*</strong> at its center, which plays a crucial role in shaping our galaxy.</p>
    <p>Scientists believe these giants formed early in the universe and regulate <strong>star formation</strong> through their powerful gravitational forces.</p>

    <h2>Black Hole Research: A Glimpse Into the Future</h2>
    <p>With new technologies and methods, black hole research is advancing rapidly. Here’s a quick look at the promising tools and missions:</p>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>Black holes remain one of the most mysterious and awe-inspiring phenomena in the universe. From bending light to possibly harboring wormholes, they continue to challenge the boundaries of science and imagination. As technology advances, we may one day unlock the deepest secrets of these cosmic monsters, transforming our understanding of the universe forever.</p>
